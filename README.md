# 📝 DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal practice codes — primarily in **C++** and a few in **Python** — written as part of my journey to strengthen my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** skills and improve my problem-solving abilities.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Maintain **consistency** in daily coding practice.
- Improve **logical thinking** and problem-solving skills.
- Track my progress in **DSA topics** and competitive programming.

---

## 📂 Contents

- **C++ Codes** – Majority of the repository; focus on DSA problems, arrays, strings, recursion, searching, sorting, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- **Python Codes** – Occasional use for exploring logic, quick problem solving, or experimenting with concepts.

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- **C++17/20** – For main DSA practice.
- **Python 3.x** – For additional scripting and problem solving.
- **VS Code** – Code editor.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and progress tracking.

---

## 🚀 My Coding Principles

1. **Write by hand** – All solutions are handwritten by me; no copy-paste.
2. **Understand before coding** – No blind memorization.
3. **Iterative improvement** – Old solutions are revised for better performance.
4. **Learn from mistakes** – Errors are part of progress.

---

## 📈 Goals

- Complete DSA topic coverage.
- Participate in coding challenges.
- Build strong fundamentals for competitive programming and technical interviews.

---

## 💡 Note

This repository is **not** meant as a ready-made solutions bank.  
It is my **personal learning log**, showcasing **my own approach** to solving problems.
